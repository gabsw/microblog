# MICROBLOG

The goal of this project is to simulate a Twitter-like web application.

## Design
The implementation has followed directly [**The Flask Mega-Tutorial**](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) by Miguel Grinberg. My main objective was to get acquainted with the Flask framework.

The database was implemented through SQLAlchemy, which is  a Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper.

The visual styling was implemented through the Bootstrap library.
